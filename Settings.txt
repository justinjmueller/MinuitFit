#A '#' denotes a commented line.

#"FunctionDefinitions" sets the file name of the file containing the function definitions.
#This location is relative to where you're running the program from.
FunctionDefinitions:"ModelDefinitions.txt"

#"NRQYData" sets the file name of the file containing NR charge yield data.
#This location is relative to where you're running the program from.
NRQYData:"NRChargeYield.csv"

#"NRLYData" sets the file name of the file containing NR light yield data.
#This location is relative to where you're running the program from.
NRLYData:"NRLightYield.csv"

#"NRTYData" sets the file name of the file containing NR total yield data.
#This location is relative to where you're running the program from.
NRTYData:"NRTotalYield.csv"

#"Tolerance" affects how close to the minimum (Estimated distance to minimum - EDM) the minimizer
#needs to be before stopping. The minimizer stops when EDM < 0.01*[Tolerance]*UP (UP defined below).
Tolerance:"0.1"

#"UP" is the number of standard deviations the minimizer reports as the error bar. For example,
#UP=1 means that any reported error bars correspond to 1 standard deviation.
UP:"1"

#"MaxCalls" is the maximum number of calls the minimizer can attempt before timing out. Usually
#500 is more than sufficient to find a minimum, but a higher number may be necessary in trickier
#cases. The stopping conditions of the minimizer are EDM < 0.01*[Tolerance]*[UP] OR "MaxCalls"
#reached.
MaxCalls:"500"

#"Verbosity" determines how "loud" the minimizer is. -1 is quietest, 0 is normal, 1 is loudest.
#-1 or 0 is highly recommended. 1-3 are very loud.
Verbosity:"-1"

#"Algorithm" specifies which minimization algorithm to use. MIGRAD is a good default. A list of
#other algorithms is published on the internet in several TMinuit information packets.
Algorithm:"MIGRAD"

#"GraphTitles" specifies the title of the graphs produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs();
GraphTitles:"Total Yield at Various Fields"

#"XTitles" specifies the x-axis title of the graphs produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs();
XTitles:"Energy [keV]"

#"ZTitles" specifies the z-axis title of the graphs produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs();
ZTitles:"Yield [quanta/keV]"

#"XLow" specifies the lower bound of the energy range produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs().
XLow:"0"

#"XHigh" specifies the upper bound of the energy range produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs().
XHigh:"250"

#"YLow" specifies the lower bound of the field range produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs();
YLow:"0"

#"YHigh" specifies the upper bound of the field range produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs();
YHigh:"2000"

#"ZLow" specifies the lower bound of the yield range produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs().
ZLow:"0"

#"ZHigh" specifies the upper bound of the yield range produced by BasicModel::DrawGraphs().
ZHigh:"25"

#"LogX" specifies whether or not to set the x-axis to a logarithmic scale.
LogX:"false"

#"LogY" specifies whether or not to set the y-axis to a logarithmic scale.
LogY:"false"

#"Palette" specifies the color palette. See the TColor class reference page for a list.
#For example, kVisibleSpectrum is index 107.
Palette:"107"

#"MarkerStyle" specifies the style of the marker. See TAttMarker class reference for a list.
MarkerStyle:"21"

#"MarkerSize" specifies the size of the markers. Size is listed in pixels.
MarkerSize:"1"

#"LineStyle" specifies the style of the line. See TAttLine class reference for a list.
LineStyle:"1"

#"LineSize" specifies the size of the line. Size is listed in pixels.
LineSize:"1"

#"OutputToFile" specifies whether or not to write the graphs to a .root file.
OutputToFile:"false"

#"ROOTName" specifies the name of the output file, if output is desired.
ROOTName:"./OutputFile.root"

#"PlotScheme" specifies where to place the complete plots, as well as a base naming scheme.
#As an example, "Plots/text" will place plots in the "Plots" directory with "text" appended
#to the front of the name. The ModelType and ModelID will follow "text". The directory is
#relative to where you're running the program from.
PlotScheme:"./"

#"PlotExtension" specifies the extension of the plot to be saved. ".pdf", will save the plot
#as a PDF. There are many other options; see TPad::SaveAs() for more details.
PlotExtension:".pdf"

#"DrawPave" specifies whether or not to draw a TPaveText containing the model formula, the
#parameters, and their errors on the plot drawn by DrawGraphs().
DrawPave:"true"
