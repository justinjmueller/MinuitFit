#"Tolerance" affects how close to the minimum (Estimated distance to minimum - EDM) the minimizer
#needs to be before stopping. The minimizer stops when EDM < 0.01*[Tolerance]*UP (UP defined below).
Tolerance:"0.1"

#"UP" is the number of standard deviations the minimizer reports as the error bar. For example,
#UP=1 means that any reported error bars correspond to 1 standard deviation.
UP:"1"

#"MaxCalls" is the maximum number of calls the minimizer can attempt before timing out. Usually
#500 is more than sufficient to find a minimum, but a higher number may be necessary in trickier
#cases. The stopping conditions of the minimizer are EDM < 0.01*[Tolerance]*[UP] OR "MaxCalls"
#reached.
MaxCalls:"500"

#"Verbosity" determines how "loud" the minimizer is. -1 is quietest, 0 is normal, 1 is loudest.
#-1 or 0 is highly recommended. 1-3 are very loud.

#other algorithms is published on the internet in several TMinuit information packets.

#"ROOTV6.04" specifies whether to use "PaletteV6.04" or "Palette". This switch is here
#because ROOT v6.04+ introduce more predefined paletes. If the user is using ROOT v6.04
#or higher, then set "ROOTV6.04" to true.
ROOTV6.04:"true"
